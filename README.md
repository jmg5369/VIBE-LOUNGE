# Vibe Lounge

## Description

Are you feeling blue? Vibe Lounge can take any mood your may to feeling, and can curate your own personal webpage with custom curated quotes and music to help you feel more at ease and complete your mood. 

You don't have to create an account of any sort, and all of your previous picked moods and visits are saved in local storage so you can reflect on how you've felt over the past few weeks.
